What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a separate language from HTML.
It provides a way to control the visual presentation of HTML elements.
The Structure of CSS:

A CSS rule consists of a selector, property, and value.
Selector: Defines which HTML elements the rule should apply to.
Property: Specifies the aspect of the element you want to style.
Value: Determines the value of the property.
CSS Selectors:

Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles to.
Common selectors include element selectors (e.g., p for paragraphs), class selectors (e.g., .my-class), and ID selectors (e.g., #my-id).
example

p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
  font-size: 16px;
}
In this example, the selector is p, and the properties are font-family, color, and font-size.
Linking CSS to HTML:

CSS can be linked to HTML documents in multiple ways.
The most common method is using an external CSS file, which is linked in the HTML <head> section using the <link> element.
Internal CSS can be placed within a <style> element in the HTML <head> section.
Inline CSS can be added directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
Cascading and Specificity:

The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied and how conflicts are resolved.
Specificity determines which rule takes precedence when multiple rules target the same element.
Inheritance:

Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their child elements. For example, font properties are often inherited.
Units and Values:

CSS supports various units and values for properties, including pixels (px), percentages (%), em, rem, and more.
Colors can be defined in different ways, such as named colors, hexadecimal codes (#RRGGBB), or RGB values.
Styling Properties:

CSS provides a wide range of properties to style elements, such as text properties (font, color, text-align), background properties (background-color, background-image), box model properties (margin, padding, border), and layout properties (position, display, float).
Selectors and Pseudo-Classes:

CSS allows for more advanced selectors, including attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :nth-child), and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after).
Media Queries:

Media queries are used for responsive design. They allow you to apply different styles based on the device's screen size or characteristics.
Vendor Prefixes:

Some CSS properties may require vendor prefixes (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-) to work correctly in specific browsers.
