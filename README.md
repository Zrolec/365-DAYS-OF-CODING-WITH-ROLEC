HTML and CSS (Frontend Basics):
Learn HTML to structure web content.
Study CSS for styling and layout.
Build simple static web pages to understand the basics.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to design the documents displayed in the browsers as a web page. This language can become more interactive and attractive by using CSS ( Cascading Style Sheet) and JS (JavaScript) within it.
